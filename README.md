### 👋 Hi there, I'm Patience Bwire!
I’m a Data Analyst / Data Scientist who’s passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and drive meaningful impact.

My work and interests span three key areas:
* 🏥 Healthcare Systems – I’m especially focused on improving service delivery and resource allocation in African health systems. I love exploring questions like: Which regions are most affected by specific disease burdens? What resources do they need? And how can we plan effectively to meet those needs?
* ⚡ Energy Systems – I'm interested in how data can help optimize energy usage in households and communities, making energy more accessible, efficient, and sustainable.
* 💰 Finance – I’m fascinated by how data science can support smarter investment decisions, detect fraud, and drive financial transparency.

Currently, I’m part of the **Healthcare Team** at **Sand Technologies**, where we’re building data-driven solutions to improve healthcare delivery—starting in Rwanda, with the goal of scaling across Africa.

When I'm not working, you’ll likely find me:
* **Sharing a meal, a conversation, or a cup of tea** with friends and family.
* **Browsing used bookstores** and adding to my growing collection of **50+ classic books** (still working on reading them all!).
* **Solving jigsaw puzzles**—I enjoy the slow, calming rhythm of fitting pieces together and the sense of quiet focus it brings.
* **Taking evening walks** to unplug, reflect, and reset after a long day.
