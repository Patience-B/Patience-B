### 👋 Hi there, I'm Patience Bwire!
I’m a Data Analyst / Data Scientist who’s passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and drive meaningful impact.

**👩🏽‍⚕️ About My Work**

My interests span three core areas at the intersection of healthcare, machine learning, and signal processing:

* 🏥 Healthcare Systems – I’m especially focused on improving service delivery and resource allocation in African health systems. I love exploring questions like: Which regions are most affected by specific disease burdens? What resources do they need? And how can we plan effectively to meet those needs?
* 🧠 Medical imaging segmentation - I focus on medical imaging segmentation, with an emphasis on designing machine learning models and architectures that work well in low-resource settings. Many medical imaging datasets from African institutions are small, fragmented, and of limited quality. To address this, I explore methods for image enhancement and efficient segmentation that can be executed on personal computers. The goal is to overcome infrastructure limitations and make advanced diagnostic tools more accessible.
* 📊 Physiological data anaysis - My interest lies in analyzing non-invasive signals—such as heart and lung sounds and heart rate time series data—to uncover meaningful patterns that may point to underlying health conditions. I aim to contribute to the development of affordable and accessible monitoring tools that support early detection and better disease management, especially in underserved regions.

Currently, I’m part of the **Healthcare Team** at **[Sand Technologies](https://healthcare.sandtech.com/#RHOS_Success)**, where we’re building data-driven solutions to improve healthcare delivery—starting in Rwanda, with the goal of scaling across Africa.

When I'm not working, you’ll likely find me:
* **Sharing a meal, a conversation, or a cup of tea** with friends and family.
* **Browsing used bookstores** and adding to my growing collection of **[50+ classic books](https://heady-meeting-88a.notion.site/95c49bdd356c4a04b9df66d61e23a373?v=08441231650247fb8fe9b0702a21203d)** (still working on reading them all!).
* **Solving jigsaw puzzles**—I enjoy the slow, calming rhythm of fitting pieces together and the sense of quiet focus it brings.
* **Taking evening walks** to unplug, reflect, and reset after a long day.
