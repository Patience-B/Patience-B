### 👋 Hi there, I'm Patience Bwire!
I’m a Data Analyst / Data Scientist who’s passionate about using data to solve real-world global health problems and drive meaningful impact.

**👩🏽‍⚕️ About My Work**
My work is at the intersection of healthcare, machine learning, and signal processing, with a specific focus on developing practical, low-resource solutions for African health systems. My three main areas of interest are:

* 🏥 Healthcare Systems Analysis: I use data to improve resource allocation and service delivery in African healthcare, exploring questions about disease burden and resource needs to enhance effective planning.

* 🧠 Medical Imaging Segmentation: I design efficient machine learning models for medical image analysis that overcome limitations of small, low-quality datasets common in low-resource settings. My goal is to develop accessible diagnostic tools that can run on personal computers.

* 📊 Physiological Data Analysis: I analyze non-invasive signals like heart and lung sounds to identify patterns that reveal underlying health conditions. My work aims to create affordable and accessible monitoring tools for early disease detection and management in underserved regions.

Currently, I’m part of the **Healthcare Team** at **[Sand Technologies](https://healthcare.sandtech.com/#RHOS_Success)**, where we’re developing data-driven solutions aimed at transforming healthcare accessibility in Africa. Our mission is to improve access to essential healthcare services in rural areas while leveraging AI and data analytics to deliver actionable insights to all stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem.



When I'm not working, you’ll likely find me:
* **Sharing a meal, a conversation, or a cup of tea** with friends and family.
* **Browsing used bookstores** and adding to my growing collection of **[50+ classic books](https://heady-meeting-88a.notion.site/95c49bdd356c4a04b9df66d61e23a373?v=08441231650247fb8fe9b0702a21203d)** (still working on reading them all!).
* **Solving jigsaw puzzles**—I enjoy the slow, calming rhythm of fitting pieces together and the sense of quiet focus it brings.
* **Taking evening walks** to unplug, reflect, and reset after a long day.
