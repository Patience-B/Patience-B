## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Patience Bwire!

Iâ€™m a **Data Analyst and Data Scientist** with a passion for **global health** and a vision for how **AI can transform healthcare systems**, particularly across Africa.

Currently, Iâ€™m part of the **Healthcare Team at Sand Technologies**, where we develop data-driven solutions to improve healthcare deliveryâ€”primarily in Rwanda, with the goal of expanding our impact to other African countries.

In my free time, I volunteer as a **Coordinator** for the **Sprint Artificial Intelligence Training for the African Medical Imaging Knowledge Translation Program**. Iâ€™m passionate about building a future where **medical imaging technologies are accessible to all**â€”not just a privileged few.

Iâ€™m also a firm believer in the **African Unionâ€™s Agenda 2063: *The Africa We Want***, and I regularly tune into discussions by thought leaders shaping this vision. Itâ€™s my hope to contribute, even in a small way, to making it a reality in my lifetime.

### ðŸ§  My Interests

I'm especially interested in the **future of AI in healthcare**, with a research focus on:

* **Medical Imaging**
* **Physiological Data Analysis**

I'm driven by the belief that AI can unlock better health outcomes globally, and I actively seek out projects and collaborations that align with that mission.

### ðŸŽ¨ Outside Work

When I'm not working with data or healthcare systems, youâ€™ll likely find me:

* Browsing used bookstores and adding to my collection of **50+ classic books** (still working on reading them!)
* Solving **jigsaw puzzles**â€”I love the quiet, unhurried rhythm of fitting pieces together and the calm it brings
* Taking **evening walks** to unplug and reflect
* Playing **board games**â€”Iâ€™m a fan of games of chance
