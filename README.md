## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Patience Bwire!

Iâ€™m a **Data Analyst and Data Scientist** with a passion for **global health**. Currently, Iâ€™m part of the **Healthcare Team at Sand Technologies**, where we develop data-driven solutions to strengthen healthcare deliveryâ€”primarily in Rwanda, with a vision to scale across other African countries. You can learn more about our work [here](https://healthcare.sandtech.com/#RHOS_Success).

In my free time, I volunteer as a **Coordinator** for the **Sprint Artificial Intelligence Training for the African Medical Imaging Knowledge Translation Program**. Iâ€™m passionate about building a future where **medical imaging technologies are accessible to all**â€”not just a privileged few.

Iâ€™m also a firm believer in the **African Unionâ€™s Agenda 2063: *The Africa We Want***, and I regularly tune into discussions by thought leaders shaping this vision. Itâ€™s my hope to contribute, even in a small way, to making it a reality in my lifetime.

### ðŸ§  My Interests

I'm especially interested in the **future of AI in healthcare**, with a research focus on Medical Imaging and Physiological Data Analysis. I'm driven by the belief that AI can unlock better health outcomes globally, and I actively seek out projects and collaborations that align with that mission.

### ðŸŽ¨ Outside Work

When I'm not working with data or healthcare systems, youâ€™ll likely find me:
* **Sharing a meal, a conversation, or a cup of tea** with friends and familyâ€”thereâ€™s nothing quite like quality time with loved ones.
* **Browsing used bookstores** and adding to my growing collection of **50+ classic books** (still working on reading them all!).
* **Solving jigsaw puzzles**â€”I enjoy the slow, calming rhythm of fitting pieces together and the sense of quiet focus it brings.
* **Taking evening walks** to unplug, reflect, and reset after a long day.
