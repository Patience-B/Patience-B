## 👋 Hi there, I'm Patience Bwire!
I'm a **Healthcare Data Scientist** passionate about using data and AI to improve healthcare accessibility in Africa. 

### 👩🏽‍⚕️ About My Work

I specialize in two complementary areas at the intersection of data science, geospatial analysis, and machine learning:

#### 🏥 Healthcare Access & Systems Analysis

I use geospatial data and population modeling to map healthcare coverage and inform resource allocation decisions. At **[Sand Technologies](https://healthcare.sandtech.com/#RHOS_Success)** , I have built and maintained production-grade data pipelines that analyze travel time, facility catchment areas, and population distribution across multiple African countries. This work supports ministries of health and partners in identifying underserved populations and prioritizing interventions aligned with Universal Health Coverage goals.

**What I work on:**
* Isochrone analysis (travel-time catchment areas for health facilities)
* Population aggregation using H3 hexagonal tiles and administrative boundaries
* Healthcare accessibility scoring and gap analysis
* Data-driven facility placement recommendations

#### 🧠 Medical AI for Low-Resource Settings

I develop efficient, reliable machine-learning models for medical imaging designed to function in environments with limited specialist availability and constrained computing resources. My focus is on practical diagnostic support, not benchmark chasing — building models that can run on consumer-grade hardware and support clinicians where access to expert radiologists and high-performance infrastructure is limited.

**Current focus:**

* Efficient model architectures (MobileNet, EfficientNet) optimized for edge deployment
* Medical image segmentation using U-Net variants
* Model compression and quantization for resource-constrained environments
* Diagnostic reliability and quality considerations in real-world clinical settings

When I'm not working, you’ll likely find me:
* **Sharing a meal, a conversation, or a cup of tea** with friends and family.
* **Browsing used bookstores** and adding to my growing collection of **[50+ classic books](https://heady-meeting-88a.notion.site/95c49bdd356c4a04b9df66d61e23a373?v=08441231650247fb8fe9b0702a21203d)** (still working on reading them all!).
* **Solving jigsaw puzzles**—I enjoy the slow, calming rhythm of fitting pieces together and the sense of quiet focus it brings.
* **Taking evening walks** to unplug, reflect, and reset after a long day.
