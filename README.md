### 👋 Hi there, I'm Patience Bwire!

I’m a **Data Analyst and Data Scientist** with a passion for **global health**. Currently, I’m part of the **Healthcare Team** at [Sand Technologies](https://healthcare.sandtech.com/#RHOS_Success), where we develop data-driven solutions to strengthen healthcare delivery—primarily in Rwanda, with a vision to scale across other African countries. 

I'm especially interested in the **future of AI in healthcare**, with a research focus on Medical Imaging and Physiological Data Analysis. I'm driven by the belief that AI can unlock better health outcomes globally, and I actively seek out projects and collaborations that align with that mission. I’m passionate about building a future where **healthcare technologies are accessible to all**—not just a privileged few.

In my free time, I volunteer as a **Coordinator** for the [Sprint Artificial Intelligence Training for the African Medical Imaging Knowledge Translation Program](https://event.fourwaves.com/spark/pages). 

When I'm not working, you’ll likely find me:
* **Sharing a meal, a conversation, or a cup of tea** with friends and family.
* **Browsing used bookstores** and adding to my growing collection of **50+ classic books** (still working on reading them all!).
* **Solving jigsaw puzzles**—I enjoy the slow, calming rhythm of fitting pieces together and the sense of quiet focus it brings.
* **Taking evening walks** to unplug, reflect, and reset after a long day.
