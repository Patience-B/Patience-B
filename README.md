### 👋 Hi there, I'm Patience Bwire!

I’m a **Data Analyst / Data Scientist** who loves using data to tackle real-world challenges. I have strong interest in three core areas: healthcare systems, energy systems, and finance. In healthcare, I’m particularly passionate about optimizing service delivery and resource allocation across African health systems—answering critical questions like: Which regions are most affected by specific disease burdens? What resources do they need? And how can we plan effectively to meet those needs?

I’m also interested in energy systems, especially how data can support the efficient use of energy in households and communities. In finance, I’m curious about how to make informed investment decisions and apply data science techniques to detect fraud and promote financial transparency.

Currently, I’m part of the **Healthcare Team** at **Sand Technologies**, where we design and implement data-driven solutions to strengthen healthcare delivery—primarily in Rwanda, with an eye toward scaling across other African countries.

When I'm not working, you’ll likely find me:
* **Sharing a meal, a conversation, or a cup of tea** with friends and family.
* **Browsing used bookstores** and adding to my growing collection of **50+ classic books** (still working on reading them all!).
* **Solving jigsaw puzzles**—I enjoy the slow, calming rhythm of fitting pieces together and the sense of quiet focus it brings.
* **Taking evening walks** to unplug, reflect, and reset after a long day.
